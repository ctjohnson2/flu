# Flu modeling project

In an effort to prepare for influenza related pharmaceutical purchasing, I have created this repository for estimating flu severity in the U.S. utilizing southern hemisphere flu rates as predictors. In order to ensure patients have their medications during the flu season, the suppliers that manufacture the pharmaceuticals need as much notice as possible. Estimating the flu season as early as the summer before can give suppliers the adaquate time needed to prepare the necessary supply.

Data used in this project comes from the WHO as well as the CDC's Flu-Surv data set and can be found below.

    <caption>The seasons in blue were both done using the previous season as the validation set. Due to Covid and previous data availability, the 22-23 season (red) was the first season used as validation to stop the training and therefore carries a bias. </caption>
